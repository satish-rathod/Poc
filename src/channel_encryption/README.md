# Secure channels with encryption

Media stream encryption ensures that only the authorized users in a channel can see and hear each other. This ensures that potential eavesdroppers cannot access sensitive and private information shared in a channel. While not every use case requires media stream encryption, Video Calling provides built-in encryption methods that guarantee data confidentiality during transmission.

End-to-end encryption (E2EE) is a private communication system in which only communicating users can participate. End-to-end encryption prevents data being read or secretly modified. Data streams are encrypted by the sender, recipients retrieve the encrypted data and decrypt it themselves. Third parties do not have a means to decrypt these data streams.
